        <p>The 2022 Ferrari 296GTB is an exotic sports car that represents a new era for the Italian automaker, one that revolves around a V-6 engine and hybrid technology. While both features are rare among Ferrari's long history of road cars, they each have been employed in the company's racing campaigns. On the GTB, which stands for Gran Turismo Berlinetta, a combined 819 horsepower comes from a mid-mounted turbocharged V-6 and an electric motor that's sandwiched between the engine and the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. All that power is sent solely to the rear wheels, which when combined with the 296GTB's compact size and relatively lightweight construction should make for a hugely entertaining machine. Its beautiful bodywork and fashionable cabin look to make it a showstopping piece as well.</p>

        <h2 id="ferrari_purosangue">Ferrari Purosangue </h2>
        
        <p>We never thought we'd see the day when a Ferrari SUV became a reality, but in the wake of many successful high-dollar, high-performance sport-utes the company has finally caved to unrelenting marketplace pressure and produced 2023 Purosangue. An SUV with Ferrari's prancing horse badge on the grille won't ruin the brand, though. After all, successful iterations of the concept have served sports-car brands such as Porsche and Lamborghini quite well. It’s not only ultra-performance utes like the Cayenne Turbo or the Urus that the Purosangue will have in its crosshairs but also ultra-luxury models such as the Bentley Bentayga and the Rolls-Royce Cullinan. A thundering V-12 engine will be the only powertrain offered—why would it need anything else? The engineers have also buttressed the ‘Sangue’s ride-and-handling with a trick active suspension system to help it drive as a Ferrari should. Expect to need a hedge-fund manager's salary to afford it, of course; prices could start as high as $400,000. </p>

        <p>Ferraris are inherently special—the Prancing Horse badge represents more than 80 years of motorsports history and seven-plus decades of drool-worthy road cars. But some Ferraris stand above others, and the 2023 Daytona SP3 is one of them. The third model in Ferrari's Icona series of ultra-limited edition vehicles, the SP3 honors the trio of Ferrari 330 P4 sports-racing cars that took first, second, and third place at the 1967 24 Hours of Daytona. The SP3 features vintage styling elements borrowed from those racers such as its wraparound windshield, dramatic wheel arches, and upswept tail. Despite the throwback design nods, the SP3 is also a modern work of automotive art with numerous scoops and intakes carved into the slinky bodywork that optimize aerodynamics and powertrain cooling. Based on the 2015 LaFerrari Aperta the Daytona is even wider, which endows it with a menacing presence. It also echoes those legendary Daytona-winning race cars with its mid-mounted, naturally aspirated V-12 powertrain, which screams to 9500 rpm. Of course, the Daytona SP3 will be insanely quick and joyful when attacking a twisty country road, but it stands out among even the rarest Ferraris for its jaw-dropping styling and roaring engine note. Seeing one in the wild will be a very rare treat for a few lucky car spotters as only 599 SP3s will ever be built. </p>
